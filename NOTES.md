# NOTES

These will be refactored later.

## Iroh

*  [iroh-node-util code showing SSH key handling](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-node-util/blob/3e9702ad215b9b986c6d45e4762a8fbe241163b0/src/fs.rs#L11)

## Coordinator Consistency & Resilience
Avoiding a single-point-of-failure in the coordinator functionality of the fleet is possible with the following approaches:

* With the number of coordinators â‰¥ 3, it's feasible to use a distributed storage engine that relies on a consensus algorithm such das Raft to have immediate consistency. In this scenario there needs to be at least 2 coordinators online for write operations.
* Using an eventual consistency model would allow even offline-write operations, at the cost of having intermittently inconsistent state. It's to be evaluated whether such a model can be a fit for the architecture requirements.

## Persistence

There are multiple runtime data types that are subject to persistence for the desired lifetime of the fleet:

### Fleet metadata
Fleet metadata persistence is handled by the coordinator instances.


* Coordinator instances
    * Q: what distributed storage is used by the coordinators?
    * Q: are all coordinators equal or is there a leader? this probably depends on the type of distributed storage that's used
* Enrolling Agents
    * Type
    * History of submitted facts
* Enrolled Agents
    * Type
    * History of submitted facts
    * Artifact graph
    * Reference to known artifact graph node
* Credentials map
* Audit logs



### Artifacts

At first all artifacts are actually nix build outputs. It's worth considering that all artifacts could be content addressable and the fact that it's a nix build output could be irrelevant.

Question: is there any use-case that's not covered by a content-addressed store?

Could the content-addressed store be embedded in the coordinator process or should it run seperately?

#### Nix Build Outputs

We certainly want to store Nix build outputs somewhere and need to make them retrievable by the Agent.
As it's a requirement that the Agent doesn't have to evaluate its configuration, it's feasible to drop `nix` as a runtime dependency on the Agent altogether.
This frees up the choice of protocols for transferring the artifacts, e.g. there's no need to stay within the limitations of the Nix Binary Cache protocol

#### Evaluation Snix' CAStore

* Currently Write/Insert Only, No GC
* Could CAStore be embedded in the rust application and use iroh for transport?
* What is the consensus mechanism among CAStore nodes, if any?
